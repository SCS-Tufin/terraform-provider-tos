  application_pack_id = length(data.tos_application_packs.packs_for_interface.application_packs) > 0 ?data.tos_application_packs.packs_for_interface.application_packs[0].id : 0
  tag                 = length(data.tos_application_packs.packs_for_interface.application_packs[0].tags) > 0 ? data.tos_application_packs.packs_for_interface.application_packs[0].tags[0] : ""

  customer = var.customer
